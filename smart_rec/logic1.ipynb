    "### **Implementation Logic for Enabling/Disabling the Input Form Based on Radio Button Selection**  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1️⃣ Placement of the \"Buying/Selling\" Selection**  \n",
    "- The radio buttons will be placed **at the top of the input form**, right below the page header, but **above all user input fields.**  \n",
    "- This ensures that the user must **first select an option before interacting with the form.**  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2️⃣ Initial State of the Form (Disabled State)**\n",
    "- When the page loads, the entire input form (including all fields) should be **disabled (greyed out).**  \n",
    "- This is achieved by setting the form inputs to **disabled by default** in the front-end.  \n",
    "- Disabled inputs will be **visually greyed out** and will **not accept user input or clicks.**  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3️⃣ Logic for Enabling the Form**\n",
    "- When the user selects either **\"Buying\"** or **\"Selling\"**, an event listener will detect the selection.  \n",
    "- The system will then **enable all form fields dynamically** so that the user can input their details.  \n",
    "- If the user **changes their selection**, the form remains enabled (no need to disable again).  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4️⃣ Frontend Files to Modify**  \n",
    "- **`templates/index.html`** → Modify this file to add the radio buttons and set up the input form with a disabled state.  \n",
    "- **`static/js/main.js`** → Implement JavaScript logic to listen for changes in radio button selection and enable/disable the form dynamically.  \n",
    "- **`static/css/styles.css`** → Ensure disabled fields are visually distinct (greyed out) for a clear user experience.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **5️⃣ Backend Files to Modify**  \n",
    "- **No major backend modifications required.**  \n",
    "- However, in **`routes.py`**, ensure that when handling form submissions, the system only processes input if a selection was made.  \n",
    "- If no selection is detected, return an error response to the user.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **6️⃣ Summary of Logic Flow**  \n",
    "1. **User accesses the page.**  \n",
    "2. **Form fields are disabled (greyed out).**  \n",
    "3. **User sees two radio buttons (\"Buying\" or \"Selling\") and must select one.**  \n",
    "4. **When a selection is made, JavaScript enables all input fields.**  \n",
    "5. **User can now enter property details.**  \n",
    "6. **Form is submitted to the backend only if a selection was made.**  \n",

    "### **Implementation Logic for SMART Recommendations (Buying/Selling Based Suggestions)**  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1️⃣ Overview of the Feature**  \n",
    "- The system will provide **customized recommendations** based on whether the user is **buying or selling** a house.  \n",
    "- These recommendations will be based on **predefined rules** stored in the database.  \n",
    "- When the user selects **\"Buying\" or \"Selling\"**, the system will fetch relevant suggestions and display them after price prediction.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2️⃣ Where Will the Rules Be Stored? (Standard Approach)**  \n",
    "- The recommendation rules will be **stored in the database** (best practice for scalability).  \n",
    "- A new table (`recommendations`) will be added in the **SQLite database** (or any other used DB).  \n",
    "- The system will **query this table** after the prediction to provide relevant recommendations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3️⃣ New Database Table (To Be Added in `database.py`)**  \n",
    "Table: `recommendations`  \n",
    "| id  | purpose  | condition  | recommendation_text  |  \n",
    "|---|---|---|---|  \n",
    "| 1  | Selling  | sqft_living < 1000 | \"Expanding living space could increase value by 15%.\"  |  \n",
    "| 2  | Buying  | price > 500000 | \"Consider areas with lower property tax for affordability.\"  |  \n",
    "| 3  | Selling  | no_of_bathrooms < 2 | \"Adding an extra bathroom can boost house value significantly.\"  |  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **`purpose`** → Defines if the recommendation applies to **Buying** or **Selling.**  \n",
    "- **`condition`** → Defines when the rule should be triggered.  \n",
    "- **`recommendation_text`** → The message displayed to the user.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4️⃣ Placement in the UI (Frontend - `templates/results.html`)**  \n",
    "- After the **predicted price is displayed**, a new section will show **recommendations** based on the user’s selection.  \n",
    "- If the user selected **\"Buying\"**, the system will **only show buying-related suggestions.**  \n",
    "- If the user selected **\"Selling\"**, the system will **only show selling-related suggestions.**  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **5️⃣ Logic for Fetching and Displaying Recommendations**  \n",
    "1. **User selects \"Buying\" or \"Selling\" (from radio buttons).**  \n",
    "2. **User enters property details and submits the form.**  \n",
    "3. **The system processes the input and predicts the price.**  \n",
    "4. **After prediction, the system queries the `recommendations` table** to find suggestions that match:  \n",
    "   - **User's selection (\"Buying\" or \"Selling\")**  \n",
    "   - **Relevant conditions based on user input (e.g., small house size, high price, fewer bathrooms, etc.)**  \n",
    "5. **Matching recommendations are sent to the frontend and displayed below the predicted price.**  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **6️⃣ Frontend Files to Modify**  \n",
    "- **`templates/results.html`** → Add a new section to display recommendations dynamically.  \n",
    "- **`static/css/styles.css`** → Style the recommendation section for visibility.  \n",
    "- **`static/js/main.js`** → Update JavaScript (if needed) to handle UI effects when displaying recommendations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **7️⃣ Backend Files to Modify**  \n",
    "- **`routes.py`** → Modify prediction route to fetch and return recommendations from the database.  \n",
    "- **`database.py`** → Add the `recommendations` table and query logic.  \n",
    "- **`predict.py`** → Ensure that after making a prediction, the system checks for matching recommendations before sending results to the frontend.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **8️⃣ Summary of Logic Flow**  \n",
    "1. **User selects \"Buying\" or \"Selling\".**  \n",
    "2. **User inputs property details and submits the form.**  \n",
    "3. **System predicts house price.**  \n",
    "4. **System queries the database for relevant recommendations.**  \n",
