    "### **Implementation Logic for SMART Recommendations (Buying/Selling Based Suggestions)**  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1️⃣ Overview of the Feature**  \n",
    "- The system will provide **customized recommendations** based on whether the user is **buying or selling** a house.  \n",
    "- These recommendations will be based on **predefined rules** stored in the database.  \n",
    "- When the user selects **\"Buying\" or \"Selling\"**, the system will fetch relevant suggestions and display them after price prediction.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2️⃣ Where Will the Rules Be Stored? (Standard Approach)**  \n",
    "- The recommendation rules will be **stored in the database** (best practice for scalability).  \n",
    "- A new table (`recommendations`) will be added in the **SQLite database** (or any other used DB).  \n",
    "- The system will **query this table** after the prediction to provide relevant recommendations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3️⃣ New Database Table (To Be Added in `database.py`)**  \n",
    "Table: `recommendations`  \n",
    "| id  | purpose  | condition  | recommendation_text  |  \n",
    "|---|---|---|---|  \n",
    "| 1  | Selling  | sqft_living < 1000 | \"Expanding living space could increase value by 15%.\"  |  \n",
    "| 2  | Buying  | price > 500000 | \"Consider areas with lower property tax for affordability.\"  |  \n",
    "| 3  | Selling  | no_of_bathrooms < 2 | \"Adding an extra bathroom can boost house value significantly.\"  |  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **`purpose`** → Defines if the recommendation applies to **Buying** or **Selling.**  \n",
    "- **`condition`** → Defines when the rule should be triggered.  \n",
    "- **`recommendation_text`** → The message displayed to the user.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4️⃣ Placement in the UI (Frontend - `templates/results.html`)**  \n",
    "- After the **predicted price is displayed**, a new section will show **recommendations** based on the user’s selection.  \n",
    "- If the user selected **\"Buying\"**, the system will **only show buying-related suggestions.**  \n",
    "- If the user selected **\"Selling\"**, the system will **only show selling-related suggestions.**  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **5️⃣ Logic for Fetching and Displaying Recommendations**  \n",
    "1. **User selects \"Buying\" or \"Selling\" (from radio buttons).**  \n",
    "2. **User enters property details and submits the form.**  \n",
    "3. **The system processes the input and predicts the price.**  \n",
    "4. **After prediction, the system queries the `recommendations` table** to find suggestions that match:  \n",
    "   - **User's selection (\"Buying\" or \"Selling\")**  \n",
    "   - **Relevant conditions based on user input (e.g., small house size, high price, fewer bathrooms, etc.)**  \n",
    "5. **Matching recommendations are sent to the frontend and displayed below the predicted price.**  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **6️⃣ Frontend Files to Modify**  \n",
    "- **`templates/results.html`** → Add a new section to display recommendations dynamically.  \n",
    "- **`static/css/styles.css`** → Style the recommendation section for visibility.  \n",
    "- **`static/js/main.js`** → Update JavaScript (if needed) to handle UI effects when displaying recommendations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **7️⃣ Backend Files to Modify**  \n",
    "- **`routes.py`** → Modify prediction route to fetch and return recommendations from the database.  \n",
    "- **`database.py`** → Add the `recommendations` table and query logic.  \n",
    "- **`predict.py`** → Ensure that after making a prediction, the system checks for matching recommendations before sending results to the frontend.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **8️⃣ Summary of Logic Flow**  \n",
    "1. **User selects \"Buying\" or \"Selling\".**  \n",
    "2. **User inputs property details and submits the form.**  \n",
    "3. **System predicts house price.**  \n",
    "4. **System queries the database for relevant recommendations.**  \n",
    "5. **Recommendations are sent to the frontend and displayed.**  \n",
    "\n",
    "The aim is to have  **intelligent, data-driven suggestions** tailored to the user’s needs, enhancing user experience and decision-making."
